# A tutorial series about programming in clojure for CS284 Evolutionary Computation. 
Each folder contains a project or markdown explaining or reviewing a certain topic. For code tutorials cd into the given tutorial directory, run <code>lein gorilla</code>, and open in your browser for an interactive gorilla repl.

#Writing Clojure
There a few tutorials that I have written here but I have found that the book [Clojure for the Brave and True by Daniel Higginbotham](http://www.braveclojure.com/) is particularly well written and freely available online. Supplementary code can also be [found on github here] (https://github.com/braveclojure/cftbat-code/). 

#Tooling
Git and Source Version Control: A great book for getting familiar with git and version control is freely available through a creataive commons license is [Pro Git by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub] (http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) and it's available in almost every format needed (pdf, mobi, epub, web, etc). It's a little lengthy but to get started one only really has to read the first three or four chapters. Expect to see a tutorial here in the coming weeks.

Linux Command Line BASH: [Another great free book on linux command line BASH by William E. Shotts, Jr.] (http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php)

Text Editors and IDEs: Emacs, Vim, Atom, Eclipse, Lightable, etc, etc, etc. CLojure programmers are fond of Emacs because it was originally built for Lisp. I prefer emacs with vim bindings (evil mode) and highly suggest using Emacs, the gorilla repl, or counterclockwise for this class. All of you should already have a developing environment but if you are interested in setting up Emacs on your machine [chapter 2 of Clojure for the Brave and True] (http://www.braveclojure.com/basic-emacs/) does an excellent job of introducing Emacs as a clojure editor/ide.

College Level Mathematics: [A series of college level math textbooks that are freely licensed and good for referencing collected and supported by the American Institute of Mathematics and the National Science Foundation] ( http://aimath.org/textbooks/approved-textbooks/)
