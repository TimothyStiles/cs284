#How to write and receive a grant to support your research.

Hampshire has a [huge list of grants](https://www.hampshire.edu/corc/master-list-of-hampshire-grants) that you as a Hampshire student are capable of receiving.
Not all grants are mentioned there (The Dr. Lucy grant now has a max value of $4500 per student per year). However, you'll notice that you will
have a hard time finding a grant that will mention computer science. No worries! There are plenty of ways for you to find some funding for your work.
You just need to know how to convey you work to different grant committees so that they can see how your work relates to what the grant
is supposed to support.

Each grant usually requires you to submit the following:

Personal info

Project statement (This is where you explain why your work matters to your potential funders and why you are qualified to do such work.)

CV or Résumé

Letter of support from your collaborator

Letter of recommendation from your advisor or another professor

Proposed Budget (as spreadsheet)

Your personal info, CV, and letters will almost always be the same for each grant that you apply to. Dependent on what expenses the
grant actually covers you should adjust your budget accordingly!

Also, do not wait until the last minute to get your letters of support and recommendation. It is polite to give everyone you have asked for recommendations from a couple of weeks to get back to you. (Note: Lee writes awesome letters of recomendation.)

What varies the most between your grant applications will be the project statement. Every grant wants it done differently but this is usually where you make
the argument that your project is relevant to the purpose of the grant.

For example the Culture, Brain, and Development grant requires you to relate your project to literally to two of the three themes of culture, brain, and development.
For my applications I explained how the automated image analysis of endothelial cell morphology could be trivially adapted to analyze neuron morphology
and made the strong connection that understanding how the vascular developed related to human development.

Other grants require other approaches. The best thing to do is to get a feel for what each grant is trying to accomplish so that you can show
them that what you are doing matters to them. Each organization is not going to do the research for you. You need to make very clear that
what you are doing matters to them. Find out what matters to them and then connect that to your own work and you will do fine!
