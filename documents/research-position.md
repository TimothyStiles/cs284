# How to get a summer academic research job.
With guest advice from Wren Saylor


TL;DR As an undergrad with little research experience you can work in any lab if you are willing to work for free, but if you want to be paid you may need to find some grants.
## Intro

As a student you can email almost any professor anywhere and say that you want to work with them and chances are you almost always be able to. Research scientists always need extra hands about the lab but not all are able to pay for them.

Now this tutorial would suck if I told you that if you want a career in research you have to be willing to work for free. 
Don't worry. Even if some professors can't pay you out of their own pockets there are a number of student grants and research experiences for undergraduates (REUs)
that can cover your rent, personal expenses, and give you a little bit of spending money for being so excellent (which you are!).
In this post I'm going to cover how you can approach a professor about working with them for class credit, pay, a summer experience, or all three and then
in the next post cover how you can apply for grants and programs with the professor you want to work with so that you can be a paid research professional!

If you want to work with some professor most often you are going to have to be a little familiar with their field and their work.
Almost everyone in this class is now capable of working in Lee's group (which you should if you want to!) but if you have interests in other fields or other topics in
evolutionary computation and you want to work with someone you are going to have to do some research before you reach out to them.

There are a few things you should ask yourself when you are looking for a research job:

Do you find the implications of a potential research experience thrilling?

Do you enjoy doing the actual work (coding, building, pipetting, reading, writing)?

Does this person offer the kind of work that you would enjoy?

Would you enjoy working with this person?

If you answered all four of these questions with "yes", then congrats, you've found a great potential collaborator! Now you just need
to reach out to them.

The best thing to do is talk in person to this person whom you want to work with. It will give you an idea of what they are like and how
well you get along. If you can't meet them in person no biggie. If you really know you want to work with them just send them an email.
No matter how you contact them you should have already read a paper or two of their's and be ready to ask specific questions about their work
that can not be easily answered with a google search. Researchers write a lot of papers that are not often read in detail by many people.
Being familiar with their work shows that you are actually interested in working with them and it's kind of flattering. Try to connect your
interests and past experiences to what they do and eventually mention that you really like their work and want to get involved. 

If they can not pay you then that's alright. Hampshire has a number of grants to help support students doing research in the arts and 
sciences that would be happy (thrilled!) to help you out. If you have an interesting project with an interesting professor and apply to a couple of grants
with a well thought out application I almost guarantee that you will find yourself with an excellent paid summer research gig.
