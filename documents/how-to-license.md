#Code and License

So if you have been looking over code that you see posted on github you may have noticed that 
people add these little licenses at the bottom of their code that tell you what you can and cannot 
do with their code. Here are super short summaries of some of the most popular or unique licenses.
If you can't really figure them out don't worry! If you are just using the code privately it is almost
entirely safe to say that you can use that code however you see fit. However, if you do want to publish your
code you should be able to choose a license that suites your needs. These summaries are just my opinion but then again 
all law is just someone's opinion.


##MIT
You can do anything you want with this code. Just don't sue the author. An extremely popular license for it's simplicity.

[MIT License] (https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

##Apache Version 2.0
You can do anything you want with this code. Just don't patent the process the code describes or sue the author. My personal favorite and you almost always see my code with this license.

[Apache License] (http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt)

[faq] (http://www.apache.org/foundation/license-faq.html)

##Gnu Public License 2.0 & 3.0 (GPL)
You can do anything you want with this code on your own computer. If you modify and share the code under this license publicly you must submit your changes to the original author of that code. **NOTE This includes the source code that you have written that depends on code using this license.** Also you can not change the license on your copy of the original code. Linux, git, and many others are licensed under the GPL. The GPL is a little tricky to understand at first but its best use case is for when you are releasing an open source application like Inkscape and you do not want people to commercialize your work.

[Gnu Public License V3] (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt)

[Gnu Public License V2] (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.txt)

[faq] (https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-general-public-license-v3-(gpl-3))

##Affero Gnu Public License (AGPL)
If you modify or share this code as part of a networked system (think servers computing for website) then you must submit your changes to the original author of that code base. The rest of this license is pretty similar to the GPL

[Affero Gnu Public License] (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.txt)

[faq] (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html)

##Eclipse Public License
The license that the clojure community holds dear. I really don't know much about this license but I have heard it compared to the Apache V2 license as similar.

[Eclipse Public License] (https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html)

[faq] (https://eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php)

##BSD 2-Clause 
You can't sue the author and you must include a copy of the license and copyright in the code that depends on source code licensed under the BSD 2-Clause.

[BSD 2-clause](https://github.com/TimothyStiles/cs284/blob/master/documents/license-templates/bsd-2-clause.txt)

[faq] (https://tldrlegal.com/license/bsd-2-clause-license-%28freebsd%29)

##BSD-3 Clause
Same as the BSD 2-clause plus you can not use registered trademarks associated with the project that is being licensed to you.

[BSD 3-clause](https://github.com/TimothyStiles/cs284/blob/master/documents/license-templates/bsd-3-clause.txt)

[faq] (https://tldrlegal.com/license/bsd-3-clause-license-(revised))

## Creative-Commons Licenses
You normally won't find code licensed under creative-commons licenses. Typically they are used for other creative works such as illustrations, music, written works, photography, etc. If you are a creative type they are definitely worth checking out.

#Applying the license to your code
Most people just include a copy of the License as a file in the root file of their project directory and include a copyright declaration in their README.md file (See this repo for example). Some legal folks insist that you slap a license declaration on the beginning of every file in your project but this is rarely done.
