#Code and License

So if you have been looking over code that you see posted on github you may have noticed that 
people add these little licenses at the bottom of their code that tell you what you can and cannot 
do with their code. Here are super short summaries of some of the most popular or unique licenses.
If you can't really figure them out don't worry! If you are just using the code privately it is almost
entirely safe to say that you can use that code however you see fit. However, if you do want to publish your
code you should be able to choose a license that suites your needs. These summaries are just my opinion but then again 
all law is just someone's opinion.


##MIT
You can do anything you want with this code. Just don't sue the author. An extremely popular license for it's simplicity.

[MIT License] (https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

##Apache Version 2.0
You can do anything you want with this code. Just don't patent the process the code describes or sue the author. My personal favorite and you almost
always see my code with this license.

[Apache License] (http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt)

##Gnu Public License 2.0 & 3.0 (GPL)
You can do anything you want with this code on your own computer. If you modify and share the code under this license publicly
you must submit your changes to the original author of that code. Linux, git, and many others are licensed under the GPL.

[Gnu Public License V2] (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.txt)

[Gnu Public License V3] (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt)

##Affero Gnu Public License (AGPL)
If you modify or share this code as part of a networked system (think servers computing for website) then you must submit your
changes to the original author of that code.

##Eclipse Public License
The license that the clojure community holds dear.

## Creative-Commons Licenses
You normally won't find code licensed under creative-commons 

#Applying the license to your code
Most people just include a copy of the License
