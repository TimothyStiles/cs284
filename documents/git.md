Git is a command line tool that let's you save snapshots of your code that you can share or refer to later. It's incredibly useful for collaborative coding and modifying your code without unnecessary deleting or copying.

#Installation

##Linux users

Most of you linux users should be pretty familiar with the command line. To install git just use the package manager that comes with your operating system.

Debian, Ubuntu, and Linux Mint users:

<code> sudo apt-get git </code>


Linux Standard Base and Red Hat Enterprise users:

<code> sudo yum install git </code>


Arch Linux users:

<code> sudo pacman -S git </code>

After your package manager has installed git check to see if the most recent version has been installed. (At least Git 2.0)

<code> git --version </code>

## Mac OSX users

So Mac OSX has a handy little package manager called [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) that is not installed by default. You should definitely install it if you don't have it already! The installation and use instructions are [here] (http://brew.sh/), but all you really need for now is to paste the following into your terminal.

Installing Homebrew:

<code>/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)
 </code>

Installing Git:

<code>brew install git </code>

After your package manager has installed git check to see if the most recent version has been installed. (At least Git 2.0)

<code> git --version </code>

## Windows users
