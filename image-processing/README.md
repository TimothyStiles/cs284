## Install 
<code>git clone https://github.com/TimothyStiles/cs284.git</code>

## Usage
Open <code>image-processing/src/image_processing/core.clj</code> in your favorite text editor and load the namespace into a clojure repl.
Follow along as I demonstrate a couple of key functions in image processing and then try to write some
interesting image processing code of your own using the resources listed in the tutorial!
